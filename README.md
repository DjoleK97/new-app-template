## 🧠 Visual Design Guidelines – Gestalt Principles

The UI design of *Seoska korpa* follows key Gestalt principles to ensure a cohesive, accessible, and intuitive user experience across all touchpoints:

### 🔸 Proximity
Related elements are visually grouped. Form fields, product details, and navigation items are spaced to reflect their logical relationship. This improves readability and scanability across components like product cards, checkout forms, and navbars.

### 🔸 Similarity
Elements serving similar purposes share consistent visual properties. All primary action buttons (e.g., “Order Now”, “Add to Cart”) use the standardized `seoskaGreen` variant with unified typography, iconography, and hover behavior.

### 🔸 Figure-Ground
Visual hierarchy is reinforced by separating foreground elements (e.g., hero section visuals, CTAs) from the background using contrast, shadows, and color layering, guiding user attention effectively.

### 🔸 Closure
Partial or stylized illustrations suggest complete forms to create more playful and rustic visuals. This approach is applied in icons, loaders, and decorative UI elements.

### 🔸 Continuity
Layouts follow a natural flow that guides the user through actions—especially in linear processes like “How to Order”. Directional elements (e.g., arrows, numbering, alignment) reinforce a smooth visual journey.

### 🔸 Common Region
Related content is enclosed in visual containers such as cards, sections with soft background shades, or bordered regions. This structure clarifies grouping, especially in “Stories from households”, “Our Baskets”, and contact forms.
